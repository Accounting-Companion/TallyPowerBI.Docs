For now we provide support for SQLSever and SQLite database, In future we will add support for other datbase providers

### As part of this service 
- we will provide semantic model which has reusable dax meaures and calculation groups  
- we will also provide generally used reports using above measures and calculation groups
- we provide support on setting up or bugs in above reports and dax calculations

### Extra Services at additional cost
- We also provide custom report or dashboard services based on requirement
- we provide support in creating new dax measures or just consult

## 
We recommend using Microsoft Fabric instead of just PowerBI plan, as Fabric provides SQL server at no extra cost
